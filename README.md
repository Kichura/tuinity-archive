# Introduction
This is an repository of where the Tuinity JAR for 1.16.5 is stored at for archival purposes, Using this server JAR will not provide you support as Tuinity has long been merged into PaperMC. However it has been updated to continue working for a long while until it eventually ceases to work entirely.

# Why
I have no interests in 1.8.x server software in general mainly due to the fact that they solely exist for PvPing purposes and that they oftenly break harder than 1.16.5 has in terms of stability. And that Tuinity has worked out quite well for running 1.16.5 servers prior to the merge.

# Where to get
You can get the JAR by heading to the [releases page](https://github.com/Kichura/tuinity-archive/releases) where the changelogs are also stored at.

# Configuration Wiki
The documentation for `tuinity.yml` can be found [here](https://github.com/Tuinity/Tuinity/wiki/Config).
